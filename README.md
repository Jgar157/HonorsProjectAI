Honors Project for COP 3003

# Schedule (May be complete in less weeks)
Week  1 -> Aug 31 2020
Course Overview ✓
- Try solutions on your own first

Week  2 -> Sept 7
Introduction to AI ✓
- AI: Attempt to build machines capable of simulating intelligent human behavior
- ML: The science behind getting computers to act without being explicitly 
- Turing Test: Idea that computer and human should interact via command line with observer mointoring the dialogue. observer will be told that one of the participants ic omputers, and if the observer can't state which is human then the machine passes the test.
- It's important to know that intellgence and processing power are different.
- Data Exhaust is the trail of data that you leave behind throughout your day

Week  3 -> Sept 14
Data and Information ✓
- Data: Something to collect. Plural of datum.
- Info: The data in context, made meaningful.

Week  4 -> Sept 21
Categorizing Data ✓
- Supervised Learning: There is information but not enough information to learn.
  - Training algorithms need flexibility, otherwise it won't know how to handle new code.
- Unsupervised Learning: Structure of data is unknown and you're going in blind with the data.
  - Algorithms will draw inferences from datasets.
- Regression: when ranges of data are stored using real numbers Ex: Rainwater in mm
